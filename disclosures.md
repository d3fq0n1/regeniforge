## Abstract

This document publicly discloses the concept and architectural outline of a compact, affordable, ruggedized, and AI-powered bioreactor system designed to operate in off-grid or post-collapse environments. The system is capable of analyzing available organic or waste input (e.g., human urine, fungi, biomass) and autonomously synthesizing basic therapeutic compounds (e.g., anticonvulsants) using an embedded small language model and onboard sensors. This invention is hereby placed into the public domain as prior art, preventing future patent claims against the core concept.

## Invention Name

**Regeniforge Node**  
Alternate Titles: Bioforge, PissCore, Pharmforge, Apothecary Engine

## Problem Addressed

Access to life-saving medication is centralized, fragile, and profit-driven. In unstable regions or during system collapse, the ability to synthesize basic pharmaceuticals from locally available materials may determine survival. This device seeks to provide autonomous, open pharmacological synthesis using organic waste streams and embedded AI guidance.

## Components

1. **Embedded Compute Module**
   - Raspberry Pi 5, Jetson Nano, or RockPi with optional TPU/NPU
   - Capable of running distilled local LLMs (BioGPT, BioBERT, etc.)

2. **Bioreactor Core**
   - 1–5L fermentation vessel
   - Integrated heating, stirring, and ventilation loops
   - Modular add-ons: airlock, UV sterilizer, nutrient reservoirs

3. **Sensor Stack**
   - Temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and CO₂
   - Data fed into model to determine reaction time and viability

4. **Input Feedstock**
   - Urine, fungi, biomass, glucose, vitamin precursors
   - Target compounds: pyridoxine analogs, ethanol, esters, basic nootropics, antibiotics

5. **AI Model & Interface**
   - Embedded LLM guides process, interprets user intent, adjusts parameters
   - No internet required
   - Optional voice interface or tactile feedback display

6. **Power Supply**
   - Solar + battery preferred
   - AC or DC optional inputs
