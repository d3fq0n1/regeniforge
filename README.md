# Regeniforge Node

> **Autonomous Bioreactor. AI-Guided. Open-Source. Collapse-Proof.**

Regeniforge is an open-source pharmacological bioreactor system powered by a local AI model. Designed for resilience, it enables the synthesis of basic therapeutic compounds from waste materials — even in post-collapse or off-grid conditions.

Originally conceived as part of **Plan R**, Regeniforge is a blueprint for pharmacological sovereignty in the age of systemic instability.

## 🔬 What It Is

A rugged, compact bio-reaction unit equipped with:

- 💻 Embedded compute (Raspberry Pi 5 / Jetson Nano / RockPi)
- 🧠 On-device AI for guiding synthesis (BioGPT / BioBERT / custom LoRA)
- 🧪 1–5L bioreactor core with integrated heating, stirring, and ventilation
- 🌡️ Sensor suite (pH, temp, turbidity, dissolved gases)
- 🔋 Off-grid power compatibility (solar, battery, AC/DC)
- 🔁 Designed to run **fully offline**

---

## ⚗️ What It Can Do

- Turn **urine, fungi, or biomass** into:
  - Anticonvulsant analogs (e.g., pyridoxine derivatives)
  - Fermentation products (ethanol, esters)
  - Cultural extracts (basic antibiotics, anti-inflammatory compounds)

- Interpret user prompts to:
  - Propose synthesis paths
  - Adjust conditions in real-time
  - Offer readable, offline instructions

## 🧠 Philosophy

**Regeniforge isn’t just a device.  
It’s a refusal.**

To accept pharmaceutical monopolies.  
To die preventably in a broken system.  
To wait for saviors.

**Plan R lives. Regeniforge breathes.  
Let’s build.**
